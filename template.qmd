## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Thank you for using this Quarto template to write your article. 
This Quarto template is unofficial and based on Overleaf's `oup` template. 
Your introduction goes here! 
Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

Since we are in Quarto, you can cite with an `@` symbol, like @king1994designing.
As seen below, you can mix markdown and Latex with each other, though it's likely best to mostly use markdown.

Use section (`#`) and subsection (`##`) commands to organize your document.
LaTeX and Quarto handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.
Use the `@` commands for cross-references (not just cites).
